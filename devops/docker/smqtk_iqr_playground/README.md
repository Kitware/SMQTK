SMQTK IQR Playground and Turn-key container
===========================================

We provide the docker container images:

    ``kitware/smqtk/iqr_playground_cpu``
    ``kitware/smqtk/iqr_playground_nvidia``

This is a self-contained SMQTK playground environment that can also act as an
image-to-application turn-key application container. As an application, this
container can compute fresh models on mounted imagery using a default
configuration setup, using a custom configuration setup, or to run the IQR
web-app with completely custom models, database and configuration. The option
is also available to run the Nearest-Neighbor and IQR RESTful services instead
of the IQR GUI web-app.


Quick Information
-----------------

Default IQR web-app login:

    username: demo
    password: demo

This is modifiable via a JSON file located in the container:

    /home/smqtk/smqtk/source/python/smqtk/web/search_app/modules/login/users.json

Container internal data directories for volume mounting:

    /home/smqtk/data/configs/   -- all configuration files
    /home/smqtk/data/db.mongo/  -- MongoDB database data files
    /home/smqtk/data/db.psql/   -- PostgreSQL database data files
    /home/smqtk/data/images/    -- directory for automatic image discovery
    /home/smqtk/data/logs/      -- all generated log and stamp files
    /home/smqtk/data/models/    -- common directory for model files


Running IQR on New Imagery
--------------------------
One way to use this contianer is to treat it like an command line tool for
spinning up a new IQR ingest on a directory of images. This will pick up files
recursively in the mounted directory (uses command ``find <dir> -type f``):

    docker run -d -v <abs-img-dir>:/home/smqtk/data/images -p 5000:5000 kitware/smqtk/iqr_playground_cpu -b [-t]

    OR

    docker run -d --runtime nvidia -v <abs-img-dir>:/home/smqtk/data/images -p 5000:5000 kitware/smqtk/iqr_playground_nvidia -b [-t]

The use of ``--runtime nvidia`` is required to use the GPU computation
capabilities (default options, can be changed and described later).
The ``-v`` option above shows where to mount a directory of images for
processing. The ``-p`` option above shows the default IQR web-app server port
that should be exposed.

The entrypoint in this container can take a number of options:

    -h | --help
        Display the usage and options description.

    -b | --build
        Build model files for images mounted to /home/smqtk/data/images

    -t | --tile
        Transform input images found in the images directory according to
        the provided generate_image_transform configuration JSON file.

    --rest
        Runs NearestNeighbor and IQR REST (gui-less) services **instead of**
        the IQR web-app.

When starting a new container, imagery must be mounted otherwise there will be
nothing to process/ingest. The ``-b`` option must also be given in order to
trigger model building.


RESTful services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start the container in RESTful mode, simply add the ``--rest`` flag when
running the ``[nvidia-]docker run ...`` command. This flag **only** changes
what is run after models are (optionally) built.

Instead of running on port 5000, the NearestNeighbor and IQR service are
exposed on ports 5001 and 5002, respectively.


Runner Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Included here is the bash script ``run_container.*.sh``. This is intended to
be a simple way of running the container as is (i.e. with default
configurations) on a directory that [recursively] contains imagery to index
and perform IQR over.

This scripts may be called like as follows:

    $ run_container.cpu.sh /abs/path/to/image/dir [-t]

The above will run the container (CPU version in this case) as a daemon,
mounting the image directory and publishes the port 5000, resulting in a
running container named ``smqtk_iqr_cpu``.
The script then shows updating information about ongoing processing in the
container.

The ``--rest`` option can also be passed here to instead run the RESTful
services instead of the IQR GUI application.

The container and version used are defined by variables at the top of the
script, as well as what host port to publish to.

When all the logs settle, mainly the ``runApp.IqrSearchDispatcher.log``,
showing that the server has started, will the web application be functional
and interactive.


Saving Generated Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If models or other generated data from this container is to be saved in a more
perminent manner, the container should be started with more volume mounts than
just the input image directory in order for content to be saved to the host
filesystem instead of just within the container's filesystem.

Directories used in the container's filesystem:

- ``/home/smqtk/data/logs``
  - Default directory where log files are saved for commands processed.

- ``/home/smqtk/data/models``
  - Generated model files are saved here by default. Stamp files recording
    successful completion are saved in the log output directory.

- ``/home/smqtk/data/db.psql``
  - Directory where PostgreSQL database is generated if not mounted by the
    user.

- ``/home/smqtk/data/db.mongo``
  - Directory where MongoDB database is generated if not mounted by the user.

- ``/home/smqtk/data/image_tiles``
  - Directory where image tiles are save if the ``-t`` or ``--tile``
    options are provided.


Using Custom Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While the default configuration files are fine for producing a generally usable
IQR instance, configurations may be extracted, modified and mounted to
``/home/smqtk/data/configs/``.

Extracting and modifying the default configuration files from the container is
probably the simplest way of customizing things. The following is a bash
snippet that will copy a ``configs`` directory containing the container's
default configs:

    $ docker run -dt --entrypoint bash --name ${CNAME} kitware/smqtk/iqr_playground_cpu
    $ docker cp ${CNAME}:/home/smqtk/data/configs/ ${OUTPUT_DIR}
    $ docker stop ${CNAME}
    $ docker rm ${CNAME}

To use the custom configuration files, simply mount the containing directory to
``/home/smqtk/data/configs`` when running the container.

**Note:** *When mounting directory of configuration files, it must containe all
configuration files that were extracted as this is the only place configuration
files are located in the container. If the entrypoint configuration was
modified, then files may be named other than their default names. Only the
``entrypoint.conf`` file cannot be renamed (assumed by entrypoint script).*

Configuration files and what they are used for:

- ``entrypoint.conf``
  - Defines container entrypoint script variables, like directories to use
    within ``/home/smqtk/data/``, the names of configuration files for the
    different tools used, and command line parameters for tools that take
    them.

- ``psql_table_init.sql``
  - Internal PostgreSQL database table initialization for image descriptor
    storage. If descriptors are to be stored in a different way, this file
    may be empty.

- ``generate_image_transform.tiles.json``
  - Configuration file for optional image tile generation. Importantly,
    this controls the size/shape of the extracted tiles.

- ``compute_many_descriptors.json``
  - Configuration file for utility that computed image content descriptors.

- ``train_itq.json``
  - Configuration file for utility that trains ITQ locality-sensitive hash
    functor models.

- ``compute_hash_codes.json``
  - Configuration file for utility that computed LSH codes for indexed
    imagery.

- ``runApp.IqrSearchDispatcher.json``
  - Configuration file for SMQTK IQR search web application. It is wise
    to change the ``SECRET_KEY`` option in here if the application is to
    be publically faced.


Troubleshooting
---------------

Q: My container quickly stopped after I executed the above "docker run..."
command.

    Re-run the ``docker run...`` with an additional volume mount to save out
    the log files: ``-v /home/smqtk/data/logs:<some-dir>``. A mroe descriptive
    error message should be present in the log for the failing utility (grep -i
    for "error").

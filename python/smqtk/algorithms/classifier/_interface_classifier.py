        Classify an input iterable of descriptor elements into a parallel
        iterable of classification elements.

        Classification element UIDs are inherited from the descriptor element
        it was generated from.

        We invoke ``classify_arrays`` for actual generation of classification
        results. See documentation for this method for further details.
        # We invoke ``classify_arrays`` for factory-generated classification
        # elements that do not yet have classifications stored, or on all input
        # descriptor elements if the ``overwrite`` flag is True.

        **Selective Iteration**
        For situations when it is desired to access specific generator returns,
        like when only one descriptor element is provided in order to get a
        single element out, it is strongly recommended to expand the returned
        generator into a sequence type first.
        For example, expanding out the generator's returns into a list
        (``list(g.generate_elements([e]))[0]``) is recommended over just
        getting the "next" element of the returned generator
        (``next(g.generate_elements([e]))``).
        Expansion into a sequence allows the generator to fully execute, which
        includes any functionality after the final ``yield`` statement in any
        of the underlying iterators that may perform required clean-up.

        **Non-redundant Processing**
        Certain classification element implementations, as dictated by the
        input factory, may be connected to persistent storage in the
        background.
        Because of this, some classification elements may already "have"
        classification results on construction.
        This method, by default, only computes new classification results for
        descriptor elements whose associated classification element does not
        report as already containing results.
        If the ``overwrite`` flag is True then classifications are computed for
        all input descriptor elements and results are set to their respective
        classification elements regardless of existing result storage.

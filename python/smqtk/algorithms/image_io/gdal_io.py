        Channel Order
        -------------
        A custom selection of input image channels as well as their order may
        be specified by the ``channel_order`` parameter.  This may either be a
        string that uses channel abbreviations or a sequence of integers

        Loader that writes the DataElement's bytes to a temporary file on
        disk first and then "opens" that file as a GDAL Dataset. This
        method performs double the I/O operations (write to disk and
        then immediately read from it again) but uses less RAM (only
        one "copy" of the image is loaded at a time) and is universally
        supported across GDAL versions.

        ``vsimem``
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        This method is more efficient in regards to run-time, however two
        copies of the image are loaded into RAM (the bytes of image for the
        virtual file and then image matrix itself). This method is also only
        functional in GDAL version 2 and above currently. A RuntimeError is
        raised if the currently imported GDAL is not version 2 or greater.

        :param load_method:
            Method of loading GDAL Dataset from a DataElement.  This must be
            one of the ``GdalImageReader.LOAD_METHOD_*`` options.
        :param channel_order:
            Optional specific selection and order of channels read from the
            image to be included in the output matrix.  See above for more

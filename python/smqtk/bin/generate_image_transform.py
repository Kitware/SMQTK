Utility for transforming an input image in various standardized ways, saving
out those transformed images with standard namings. Transformations used are
configurable via a configuration file (JSON).

            # the outside perimeter. Cropped image dimensions determined by the
            # dimensions of the base image and the number of crops to generate.

        "quadrant_pyramid_levels": null | int
            # If greater than 0, generate a number of crops based on a number of
            # quad-tree partitions made based on the given number of levels.

            # made.

            # If not null and is a list of two integers, crop out tile windows
            # from the base image that have the width and height specified.
            # If the image width or height is not evenly divisible by the tile
            # width or height, respectively, then the crop out as many tiles as
            # neatly fit starting from the axis origin. The remaining pixels are
            # ignored.

        "tile_stride": null | [x, y]
            # If not null and is a list of two integers, crop out sub-images of
            # the above width and height (if given) with this stride. When not
            # this is not provided, the default stride is the same as the tile
            # width and height.

        # Generate a number of images with different brightness levels using
        # linear interpolation to choose levels between 0 (black) and 1
        # (original image) as well as between 1 and 2.

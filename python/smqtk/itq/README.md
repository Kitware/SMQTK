ITQ: Iterative Quantization
===========================

This directory contains Python implementation of Iterative Quantization, a method to convert a descriptor (e.g. 4000-vector) to few bits (e.g. 64 bits).

The method first appeared in
```
Yunchao Gong and Svetlana Lazebnik. Iterative Quantization: A Procrustes Approach to Learning Binary Codes. In CVPR 2011.
```
It was originally implemented in Matlab by Yunchao Gong (yunchao@cs.unc.edu).

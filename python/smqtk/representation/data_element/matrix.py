class MatrixDataElement (DataElement):  # lgtm[py/missing-equals]
    """
    DataElement whose data is represented in memory by a ``numpy.ndarray``
    instance.

    This implementation additionally provides a ``matrix`` property that exposes
    a natively stored ``numpy.ndarray`` (may be None).  It is expected that this
    implementation is to be used with components that have ``matrix`` short-cuts
    or otherwise where the matrix is the important that data is accessed often.

    Since the ndarray is stored natively, ``get_bytes()`` bytes are generated on
    the fly based on the current state of matrix.  The ``writable()`` method on
    this instance only pertains to both the ``set_bytes()`` method AND
    ``matrix`` property setter.

        is usable.

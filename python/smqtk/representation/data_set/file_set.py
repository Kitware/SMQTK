    File-based data set

    This implementation serializes each stored DataElement to a single file on
    disk. The only memory overhead for this implementation is the mapping of
    data element original UUID to the file path on disk.

    File sets are initialized with a root directory, under which it finds and
    serializes DataElement instances. DataElement implementations are required
    to be picklable, so this is a valid assumption.

    Serializations are saved/loaded with respect to a ``uuid_chunk`` property,
    which defines how files are split into subdirectories based on their UUID.
    This is helpful when a lot of files are being stored as too many files in a
    single directory generally slows down filesystem access to that directory.

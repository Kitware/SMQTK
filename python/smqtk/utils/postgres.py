        Batch the given iterable into ``batch_size`` chunks, calling the given

        This is generally intended for when the use of the
        ``cursor.executemany`` function is appropriate for statements other than
        SELECT or VALUES.

        When performing a query with a large number of component elements, the
        time between performing the query and getting the first response can be
        long. Additionally, the whole query would need to be constructed first
        which may take a long time or consume a large amount of memory for large
        iterables.

        Splitting an iterable of elements up into batches lessens the
        construction time and memory foot-print of each individual query. This
        in turn improves the response time for individual queries to the server
        as well as keeping the local memory requirements static. A fast response
        time means that results can be iterated out and errors can be revealed
        more quickly.

        This method handles creating a new connection and cursor, ensuring the
        a table's existence (if that query was set) and pulling together batches
        of the given size from the provided opaque iterable.

            perform ``executemany`` actions on the provided cursor for the given
            batch. Results are optionally yielded af this call successfully
            returns.

    """ Reentrant Read-Write for multiprocessing

    Allows multiple threads/processes to simultaneously hold a read lock, while
    allowing only a single thread/process to hold a write lock at the same point
    of time.

    WARNING: This lock is NOT write-lock re-entrant. Attempting to acquire a
    write lock within a write lock WILL cause a dead-lock.

    When a read lock is requested while a write lock is held, the reader
    is blocked; when a write lock is requested while another write lock is
    held or there are read locks, the writer is blocked.

    When resolving who acquires the lock between readers and writers, writers
    are always preferred by this implementation: if there are blocked
    threads waiting for a write lock, current readers may request more read
    locks (which they eventually should free, as they starve the waiting
    writers otherwise), but a new thread requesting a read lock will not
    be granted one, and block. This might mean starvation for readers if
    two writer threads interweave their calls to acquireWrite() without
    leaving a window only for readers.

    NOT IMPLEMENTED :: TODO ::
    In case a current reader requests a write lock, this can and will be
    satisfied without giving up the read locks first, but, only one thread
    may perform this kind of lock upgrade, as a deadlock would otherwise
    occur. After the write lock has been granted, the thread will hold a
    full write lock, and not be downgraded after the upgrading call to
    acquireWrite() has been match by a corresponding release().
        - could add a acquireWriteUpgrade method for the specific purpose of
          acquiring a write lock in the presence of readers.

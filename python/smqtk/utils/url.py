def url_join(url, *urls):
    r"""
    Join one or more URL components intelligently.

    The return is the concatenation of ``url`` and any members of ``*urls`` with
    exactly one slash ("/") following each non-empty part except the last,
    meaning the result will only end in a trailing slash if the last part is
    empty. If a component starts with a protocol-like string or a leading slash,
    all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from that
    part.

    We define "protocol-like" as something matching the regex "\w+://".

    Leading slashes reduced to a single leading slash if multiple are present.

    This function is different in that we allow the joining of relative URLs
    that do not start with a protocol component.

    :param url: First URL component
    :type url: str

    :param urls: path components to join with slashes.
    :type urls: string-castable

    :return: Joined URL string
    :rtype: str
